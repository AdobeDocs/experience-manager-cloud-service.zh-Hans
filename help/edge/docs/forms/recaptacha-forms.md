# 将 reCAPTCHA 与 AEM Forms as a Cloud Service 的 Edge Delivery Services 结合使用

reCAPTCHA 是一种流行的工具，用于保护网站免受欺诈活动、垃圾邮件和滥用。在 Edge Delivery Services 中，自适应表单块提供了添加 Google reCAPTCHA 的功能，以区分人类和机器人。此功能允许用户保护他们的网站免受垃圾邮件和滥用。
例如，考虑一个收集旅行开始和结束日期、房间预算、预计旅行费用和旅行者信息等数据的查询表。在这种情况下，存在恶意用户利用该表单发送网络钓鱼电子邮件或使用垃圾邮件机器人向其中发送不相关或有害内容的风险。集成 reCAPTCHA 可验证提交内容是否来自真实用户，从而提供额外的安全性，有效减少垃圾邮件条目。

Edge Delivery Services 仅支持 **基于分数(v3)-reCAPTCHA** 用于自适应表单块。

By the end of this article, you learn to:
  * [Enable Google reCAPTCHA's for a single form](#enable-google-recaptchas-for-a-single-form)
  * [Enable reCAPTCHA for all the forms on your Site](#enable-recaptcha-for-all-the-forms)

## Pre-requisite

Register your domain with [Google reCAPTCHA and obtain credentials](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create).

## Enable Google reCAPTCHA's for a single form {#enable-google-recaptchas-for-a-single-form}

Enabling Google reCAPTCHA for a single form involves integrating Google's reCAPTCHA service into a specific web form to prevent automated abuse or spam submissions.

To enable Google reCAPTCHA's for a single form:
1. [Configure the reCAPTCHA secret key in project configuration file](#configure-secret-key)
1. [Add reCAPTCHA site key to your form](#add-site-key)


### Configure the reCAPTCHA secret key in project configuration file {#configure-secret-key}

The Site Secret for domain registered with Google reCAPTCHA is added to project the configuration file (`.helix/config`) in your AEM Project folder at Microsoft SharePoint or Google Drive. To add the Site Secret to the config file:

1. Go to your AEM Project folder on Microsoft® SharePoint or Google Drive. 
1. Create the `.helix/config.xlsx` file in your AEM Project folder in Microsoft SharePoint Site or the `.helix/config` file in AEM Project folder within your Google Drive. 

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    > The [project configuration file](https://www.aem.live/docs/configuration) is a spreadsheet located at `/.helix/config`. If the file does not exist, create it.

1. Open the `config` file and add the following key and value pairs:

    * **captcha.secret**: Google reCAPTCHA secret key value
    * **captcha.type**: reCAPTCHA v2
  
   Refer to the image for an illustration of a project configuration file:

    ![Project configuration file](/help/forms/assets/recaptcha-config-file.png)

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >  You can retrieve the reCAPTCHA keys from the [Google reCAPTCHA Admin Console](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin).

1.  Preview and publish the `config` file using [AEM Sidekick](https://www.aem.live/developer/tutorial#preview-and-publish-your-content). 

### Add reCAPTCHA site key to your form {#add-site-key}

The Site Key for domain registered with Google reCAPTCHA is added to the spreadsheet of the form that is to be protected. To add the Site key to a form:

1. Go to your AEM Project folder on Microsoft® SharePoint or Google Drive and open your spreadsheet. You can also create new spreadsheet for a form.
1. Insert a row into the spreadsheet to add new field as CAPTCHA, including the following details:
    * **type**: captcha
    * **value**: Google reCAPTCHA site key value
  
    Refer to the illustration below, depicting the spreadsheet with the new row type as CAPTCHA:
  
   ![Recaptcha spreadsheet](/help/forms/assets/recaptcha-spreadsheet.png)

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >  You can retrieve the reCAPTCHA keys from the [Google reCAPTCHA Admin Console](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin).

1. Use [AEM Sidekick](https://www.aem.live/developer/tutorial#preview-and-publish-your-content) to preview and publish the sheet. 
You can refer to the [spreadsheet](/help/forms/assets/recaptcha-enquiry.xlsx) that includes the form definition for an enquiry form.

After adding new row in the form definition, a reCAPTCHA badge appears at the bottom-right corner of the form. This ensures that the form is now protected from fraudulent activities, spam, and misuse.

## Enable reCAPTCHA for all the forms on your Site{#enable-recaptcha-for-all-the-forms}

To apply Google reCAPTCHA to all the forms on your Site that use Adaptive Forms Block, skip the previous steps and directly embed the `sitekey` value into the `recaptcha.js` file. To include site key value in the `recaptcha.js` file:

1. Open the corresponding GitHub repository on your local machine. 
1. Navigate to `../blocks/form/integrations/recaptcha.js` file.
1. Replace the `siteKey` with Google reCAPTCHA site key value.

    ![Recaptcha apply to all forms](/help/forms/assets/recaptcha-apply-to-all-forms.png)

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >  You can retrieve the reCAPTCHA keys from the [Google reCAPTCHA Admin Console](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin).

1. Use [AEM Sidekick](https://www.aem.live/developer/tutorial#preview-and-publish-your-content) to preview and publish the site. 

The reCAPTCHA badge starts appearing for all the forms on your Site.
