## Content Management System (CMS) {#content-management-system}

What is a Content Management System?

A Content Management System (CMS) is just what it says it is - a computer system used to manage content. That&#39;s a bit general, so to be more precise, it is (typically) used for managing content that you want to make available on your website(s).

## Headless CMS {#headless-cms}

Headless is a term used to describe systems that effectively detaches the content from the manner of displaying that content on the web.

Traditionally you would manage your content in a CMS, and the same CMS would be responsible for rendering that content on your webpages.

Now, headless means that your content-set can be managed in the CMS and then accessed by one, or more, (independent) applications.

This means that your content can be delivered to any device, in a wide range of formats. This makes the whole process much more flexible, and also means that you do not need to worry about layout and formatting.

## Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service {#aem-cloud-service}

So what is AEM?

First and foremost, AEM is a Content Management System with a wide range of features that can also be customized to meet your requirements.

This all means that it can be used as a:

* Headless CMS
   * ********This means your content can reach a wide range of devices, in a wide range of formats and with a wide selection of functionality.
(And as a double-whammy, these fragments can also be used when constructing AEM web pages - if you want.)

* &quot;Traditional&quot; CMS
   * Content is authored for web pages, using a range of components that define how the content will be rendered on your website. Even here AEM is extremely flexible as your project team can develop customized components.

## Content Modeling {#content-modeling}

So content modeling (also known as data modeling) is another technical term - why should it interest you as an author?

For the headless applications to be able to access your content, and do something with it, your content really needs to have a predefined structure. **

Basically the process of defining the structure for your content to adhere to involves designing a model - and this is called data modeling.
